Currently, `coywjs/texts` (the 'real' forms of Han characters) are not successfully turned on on Android.

On PC, `terra-pinyin` is used to use tones and input pinyins conveniently.

On Android, `terra-pinyin` has extra keys, making the keyboard layout weird and uncommon, so `luna-pinyin` is used instead.
